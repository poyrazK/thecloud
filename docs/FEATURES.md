## 🏗️ Core Infrastructure

### 1. Compute (Instances)
**What it is**: Launch virtual machines or containers to run applications.

**Tech Stack**: 
- **Docker Engine** (Container Backend - Simulators)
- **Libvirt/KVM** (VM Backend - Production)
- **Go** (Backend with unified `ComputeBackend` interface)

**Implementation**:
- **Multi-Backend Architecture**: The system supports two compute backends via a unified `ComputeBackend` interface:
  
  **Docker Backend** (Simulation/Dev):
  - **Simulation**: Uses Docker Containers to simulate instances with sub-second boot times.
  - **Isolation**: Process-level isolation via namespaces.
  - **Networking**: Instances attach to custom Bridge Networks (simulating VPCs).
  - **Persistence**: Docker Volumes for persistent storage.
  
  **Libvirt Backend** (Production/KVM):
  - **Real VMs**: Uses KVM/QEMU for full hardware virtualization.
  - **Isolation**: Complete VM isolation with dedicated kernels.
  - **Console**: **VNC Console** access via dynamic websockets (`/console` endpoint).
  - **Storage**: Supports both file-based QCOW2 and raw LVM block devices.
  - **Networking**: Integrated with Open vSwitch (OVS) for true SDN.

- **Backend Selection**: Set via `COMPUTE_BACKEND` environment variable (`docker` or `libvirt`).
- **Lifecycle**: The `InstanceService` manages the backend API to Create, Start, Stop, and Remove instances.
- **Instance Metadata & Labels**: Support for arbitrary key-value pairs assigned to instances for organization and filtering.
- **Cloud-Init (Docker Simulation)**: Simulates Cloud-Init configuration injection in containers (SSH keys, script execution).

## 🚀 How It's Built
We use a **Clean / Hexagonal Architecture**:
1.  **Adapters (Handlers/Repositories)**: External facing code (HTTP, SQL, Docker).
2.  **Core (Services/Ports)**: Pure business logic (e.g., "Create Instance", "Hash Password").
3.  **Domain**: Shared Go structs and entities.

This ensures that we can swap out Docker for Kubernetes, or Postgres for SQLite, without changing the core business logic.
